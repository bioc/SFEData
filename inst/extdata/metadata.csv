"Visium mouse skeletal muscle 2 days post notexin injury","Space Ranger processed Visium data from 'Large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data captures transitional progenitor states in mouse skeletal muscle regeneration' was downloaded from GEO. The gene count matrix, Visium spot polygons, tissue boundary polygons, and myofiber and nuclei segmentation are stored in a SpatialFeatureExperiment (SFE) object. Morphological metrics of the segmented myofibers and nuclei are also included.","3.16","GRCm38","MTX","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM4904759","","Mus musculus","10090",NA,"Cornell University","Lambda Moses <dlu2@caltech.edu>","SpatialFeatureExperiment","Rds","SFEData/sfe_vis5a.rds"
