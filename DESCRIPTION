Description: 
    Example spatial transcriptomics datasets with Simple Feature annotations
    as SpatialFeatureExperiment objects. In the first version, the only full
    dataset is a mouse skeletal muscle Visium dataset 2 days after notexin
    injury from 'Large-scale integration of single-cell transcriptomic data 
    captures transitional progenitor states in mouse skeletal muscle 
    regeneration'. More datasets will be added in later versions.
